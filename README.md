# Stronghold-2016

If you want to make changes to the code, create a branch with your initials followed by what the branch's purpose is (intake subsystem, fixing some method in drivetrain, etc.) all in lowercase with dashes for spaces. When you're ready, create a pull request and Dani will review it at the next meeting.

If you want something to do, take a look at the issues and assign yourself to one that's not taken. Ones with the label "rookie" are great for beginners.
